## My current setup

### Computer & OS

My main computer is a 2019 [14" System76 Lemur Pro](https://system76.com/laptops/lemur) which I run Ubuntu 22.04 on with the following specs:

- 24GB RAM
- 1TB SSD
- 8 core Intel i5

This laptop does pretty well handling all of my development needs. I have a few other computers that I use for different things, but this is my main one. If you are doing mostly web development and need good portability, this is good enough to get the job done at a reasonable price.

### Terminal

For my terminal I use [Terminator](https://gnome-terminator.org/) which works really well for me, its always been very efficient (for being I believe written in python). The window splitting is great in it, I rarely find myself needing to use Tmux.

I'm using ZSH and [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) for my shell. I really only use the git plugin for it, I create a lot of custom aliases for my projects and common commands that I use.

### Editor

For my primary editor I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extensions:

I also use [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) for PHP development.

### Browser

For my browser I use [Brave](https://brave.com/). I use it because the built-in ad blocker is pretty nice, and I can sync my bookmarks and history across all of my devices.

### Other

For my other tools I use:

For quick launching of apps I use [Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/), which is by far one of my favorite tools. I use it to launch apps, search my computer, and search the web. I also use it to launch my terminal and open files in my editor.

For Database management I use [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/).

Other tools I use are:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [1Password](https://1password.com/)
- [Tinkerwell](https://tinkerwell.app/)
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
- [Ray](https://spatie.be/products/ray)


That is mostly it for applications, I often just use the browser for other things like slack, discord, and zoom. I also use the browser for my email and calendar. Everything else I use the terminal for.

That about wraps it up for my setup, I like to keep things simple, and I like to keep things fast. I hope you enjoyed this post and if you have any questions feel free to ask.
